# MLP-Plotter

MLP-Plotter is a simple web-based tool for visualizing the structure of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. You can specify the number of layers and units in each layer, as well as customize the appearance of the nodes and connections.

## Features

- Specify the number of layers and units in each layer
- Customize node color, line color, line width, and node radius
- Adjust the spacing between layers
- Choose whether connections start from the center or edge of the nodes
